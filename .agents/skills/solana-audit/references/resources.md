# Public Solana Audit Resources

This pack is grounded in public primary sources first, then in comparable public Solana security corpora when report-level coverage is thin.

Last refreshed for Solana AI Kit bounty positioning and current Solana security/source freshness: 2026-06-21.

## Comparable public Solana security corpora

These are useful when a category is real but public audit pages are sparse.

1. [Solana Program Security course archive](https://github.com/solana-foundation/developer-content/tree/main/content/courses/program-security) - archived official labs for account validation, signer auth, PDAs, reinitialization, revival, and duplicate mutable accounts. The older `solana.com/developers/courses/program-security` links redirect here.

6. Anchor v1 migration guidance used while generating this pack - a local source-of-truth for duplicate mutable aliasing hardening and lifecycle checks, referenced here as methodology rather than as packaged content.

## How to use this source index

1. Start with the relevant taxonomy file.
2. Follow the cited public examples back to the source organization.
3. If a category has thin public finding coverage, use the comparable corpus links to verify the mechanic before creating a new subcategory.
