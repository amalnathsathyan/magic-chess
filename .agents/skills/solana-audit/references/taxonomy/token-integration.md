# Token Program And Token 2022 Integration

## Aliases

- token validation bug
- mint identity mismatch
- wrong token program assumption
- Token-2022 integration hazard
- wrapped token trust bug

## What The Bug Is

This class covers program paths that assume a token account, mint, or token program is safe without validating the exact mint identity, token program variant, or extension semantics that apply to the asset.

## Why It Matters On Solana

On Solana, the same business flow may touch classic SPL Token, Token-2022, wrapped mints, ATAs, memo-required accounts, fee-bearing mints, permanent delegates, or freeze authorities. If the integration assumes "token account" implies a single behavior, the program can mis-price transfers, accept the wrong mint, or mint wrapped assets under unsafe authority assumptions.

## Exploit Mechanics

1. The attacker passes a mint, token account, or token program that satisfies only part of the program's expectations.
2. The integration validates the wrong property, or validates too little.
3. The token path executes with different fee, freeze, delegate, or close semantics than the program assumes.
4. Value is trapped, leaked, or controlled by the wrong authority.

## Review Signals

1. Code checks a token account's owner but not its mint, or vice versa.
2. Code assumes classic SPL Token semantics while accepting Token-2022 assets.
3. Wrapped-mint logic copies freeze or delegate authority from an untrusted source without a trust-model decision.
4. Mint metadata or ATA conventions are used as identity instead of the actual mint address.
5. The integration has no explicit Token-2022 support policy marking extensions as supported, rejected, or residual risk.
6. Accounting credits the requested transfer amount when transfer fees, hooks, or other nonstandard behavior can change the actual received amount.

## Anchor Notes

1. Prefer `anchor_spl::token_interface` when the integration may encounter Token-2022.
2. Validate mint, token account, token program, and stored authority as one coherent unit.
3. Review every transfer, close, and fee path separately for Token-2022 behavior.

## Native Rust / Pinocchio Notes

1. Check the token program ID explicitly before unpacking or invoking.
2. Validate mint-account contents before deriving wrapped or escrow authorities from them.
3. Avoid assuming ATA semantics if the protocol really requires a specific mint and token program combination.

## Client/Wallet Implications

Clients should detect the token program variant and extension mix before building transactions. User-visible "amount sent" may not equal "amount received" for fee-bearing mints, and memo-required destinations can fail transfers that look correct in the UI. Wallet and backend signer flows should treat unsupported extension mixes as a signing-boundary risk, not as a display-only problem.

## Mitigation Guidance

1. Validate the actual mint address and token program ID.
2. Decide whether Token-2022 is supported, then code every path for its extension semantics.
3. For wrapped assets, document which source mint authorities are trusted and which are rejected.
4. For Token-2022, maintain an extension policy with `supported`, `rejected`, or `residual risk` per extension that can affect value, authority, liveness, display, or close behavior.
5. Use pre/post balance deltas when transfer fees or nonstandard token behavior can alter the received amount.
6. Add tests with wrong token program variants, unsupported extension mixes, transfer-fee mints, transfer-hook mints, memo-required accounts, default frozen accounts, permanent delegates, close paths with withheld fees, and wrapped assets.
