# Pre Audit Intake Checklist

Use this before reviewing code. The goal is to surface trust assumptions early.

For design-stage risk reduction before a full audit, use [../workflows/pre-audit-design-review.md](../workflows/pre-audit-design-review.md) after this intake checklist. It turns unresolved architecture decisions into design assumptions, a threat model, a pre-audit checklist, and open questions.

## Core intake

1. Identify every in-scope program ID and cluster.
Why it matters: many Solana risks depend on upgrade authority, deployed address, and whether the code is already live.

2. Record the framework and runtime mix.
Why it matters: Anchor, native Rust, and client-side signing each produce different review obligations.

3. List every external dependency, including operator identity, upgrade authority, deployment provenance, and the evidence source for each external program, oracle, keeper, relayer, bridge, or multisig dependency.
Why it matters: code review and operator trust are separate. Unresolved operator identity is a residual risk or release blocker when the integration depends on that counterparty.

4. Identify every authority.
Why it matters: upgrade authority, pause authority, mint authority, freeze authority, and multisig signers define the blast radius of admin mistakes.

5. Capture the release posture.
Why it matters: a readiness review before first deploy is different from a hotfix on an already deployed program.

## Architecture intake

6. Enumerate PDA seeds and stored bumps.
Why it matters: PDA derivation mistakes are easier to catch before code review if the seed model is explicit.

7. Enumerate all CPI targets.
Why it matters: arbitrary CPI findings usually come from unclear external program assumptions.

8. Enumerate accepted token and mint assumptions for collateral, settlement, rewards, payments, or treasury assets.
Why it matters: mint identity, token program, mint authority, freeze authority, permanent delegate, metadata authority, close authority, and Token-2022 extension mix define the security model. Liquidity, holder concentration, and venue data are intake context, not confirmed program vulnerabilities by themselves.

9. Enumerate oracle and pricing sources.
Why it matters: oracle freshness, confidence, and manipulation assumptions often determine whether an economic bug is real.

10. Enumerate client or wallet signing flows.
Why it matters: boundary-layer bugs can turn a sound on-chain design into an unsafe end-user flow.

## Design-stage intake

11. Record the account model, PDA map, authority matrix, CPI map, token policy, and named economic invariants if they already exist.
Why it matters: missing design artifacts should be resolved before auditors spend time reconstructing intent from code.

12. Record unresolved design questions one at a time, with a recommended default answer and owner.
Why it matters: design uncertainty should become an explicit audit-readiness task, not a hidden assumption inside a finding.
